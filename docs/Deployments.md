# **Deployments**

Salt currently supports deploying to Discord via the Salt AI bot. 

When you’re ready to deploy, select the “Deploy” button in the top right corner. You will be prompted to give your workflow a name. Choose a unique, descriptive slug – your workflow will be discoverable by any Discord user using the Salt AI bot – then click “Deploy”.

You will see a confirmation screen when your deployment is complete. You can click to copy your workflow name to your clipboard.

You can manage and turn off your deployments at any time in the Deployments tab of your dashboard.
