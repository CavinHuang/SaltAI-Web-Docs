# Document Pack
## Documentation
- Class name: `DocumentPack`
- Category: `LLM Nodes`
- Output node: `True`

The `DocumentPack` class serves as a foundational component in a system designed to manage and document nodes within a larger framework. It primarily acts as a base class, providing essential functionalities and structures for node documentation and management. This includes methods for retrieving all node names and packs, which are crucial for organizing and accessing the various nodes available within the system.
## Input types
### Required
- **`name`**
    - The `name` parameter specifies the unique identifier of a node within a pack. It is essential for retrieving specific node documentation, as it determines which node's information is to be documented based on its unique name.
    - Python dtype: `str`
    - Comfy dtype: `STRING`
- **`chunk_lines`**
    - Specifies the number of lines each code chunk should contain. This is important for controlling the granularity of documentation and affects how code is segmented and documented.
    - Python dtype: `int`
    - Comfy dtype: `INT`
- **`chunk_lines_overlap`**
    - Determines the number of lines that consecutive code chunks will overlap. This parameter is crucial for ensuring continuity and context between chunks, enhancing the quality of generated documentation.
    - Python dtype: `int`
    - Comfy dtype: `INT`
- **`max_chars`**
    - Sets the maximum number of characters allowed in a single code chunk. This parameter helps in managing the size of documentation chunks, ensuring they are of a manageable size for processing and understanding.
    - Python dtype: `int`
    - Comfy dtype: `INT`
- **`num_retries`**
    - Indicates the number of times the documentation generation process should retry in case of failures. This parameter is important for robustness, ensuring that temporary issues do not prevent documentation from being generated.
    - Python dtype: `int`
    - Comfy dtype: `INT`
- **`top_k`**
    - Specifies the number of top results to consider when generating documentation. This parameter influences the quality and relevance of the generated documentation by focusing on the most promising results.
    - Python dtype: `int`
    - Comfy dtype: `INT`
- **`regenerate`**
    - Controls whether existing documentation should be regenerated. This parameter allows for flexibility in managing documentation updates and ensures that the most current information is always available.
    - Python dtype: `str`
    - Comfy dtype: `STRING`
- **`model`**
    - Refers to the model used for generating documentation. This parameter is critical as it determines the quality and style of the generated documentation, based on the capabilities of the specified model.
    - Python dtype: `Dict[str, Any]`
    - Comfy dtype: `MODEL`
## Output types
- **`string`**
    - The output is a tuple containing the generated documentation for the specified nodes. This provides a structured and accessible way to retrieve documentation for nodes within the system.
    - Python dtype: `Tuple[str,]`
    - Comfy dtype: `STRING`
## Usage tips
- Infra type: `GPU`
- Common nodes: unknown

The DocumentPack node is primarily used for generating and managing documentation for other nodes within a pipeline, taking as input parameters like node names, code chunk specifications, and model details, and outputs structured documentation in the form of strings. This node is essential for organizing and accessing comprehensive documentation on the various nodes available within the system, ensuring users can easily understand and manage their AI pipelines.
