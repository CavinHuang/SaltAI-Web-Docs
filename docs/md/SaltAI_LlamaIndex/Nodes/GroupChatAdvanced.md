# âˆž Group Chat (Adv)
## Documentation
- Class name: `GroupChatAdvanced`
- Category: `SALT/Llama-Index/Agents`
- Output node: `False`

This node facilitates advanced group chat functionalities, enabling the orchestration of complex interactions among multiple agents. It leverages a sophisticated set of parameters to manage group dynamics, speaker selection, and conversation flow, aiming to simulate realistic group conversations with customizable settings.
## Input types
### Required
- **`group_manager`**
    - Represents the configuration and management entity for the group chat, including settings for the chat's behavior and dynamics.
    - Comfy dtype: `GROUP_MANAGER`
    - Python dtype: `Dict[str, Union[str, int, bool, Dict[str, Union[str, List[Dict[str, str]]]]]]`
- **`init_message`**
    - The initial message to kick off the group chat, setting the tone and context for the conversation.
    - Comfy dtype: `STRING`
    - Python dtype: `str`
- **`select_speaker_message_template`**
    - Template for messages used in selecting the next speaker, allowing for dynamic speaker selection based on conversation context.
    - Comfy dtype: `STRING`
    - Python dtype: `str`
- **`select_speaker_prompt_template`**
    - Template for prompts used in selecting the next speaker, guiding the speaker selection process with specific criteria or questions.
    - Comfy dtype: `STRING`
    - Python dtype: `str`
- **`summary_method`**
    - Specifies the method used to summarize the chat, providing an overview or key takeaways from the conversation.
    - Comfy dtype: `COMBO[STRING]`
    - Python dtype: `str`
- **`max_turns`**
    - The maximum number of turns the chat can take, limiting the length of the conversation.
    - Comfy dtype: `INT`
    - Python dtype: `int`
- **`func_call_filter`**
    - A filter to control which function calls are allowed during the chat, ensuring that only appropriate interactions occur. It affects the node's execution by filtering potential speaker selections based on the presence of corresponding function names in agents' function maps.
    - Comfy dtype: `BOOLEAN`
    - Python dtype: `bool`
- **`speaker_selection_method`**
    - The method used to select the next speaker in the group chat, determining how speakers are rotated or chosen.
    - Comfy dtype: `COMBO[STRING]`
    - Python dtype: `str`
- **`allow_repeat_speaker`**
    - Determines whether a speaker can be selected consecutively, affecting the diversity of speaker turns.
    - Comfy dtype: `BOOLEAN`
    - Python dtype: `bool`
- **`send_introductions`**
    - Controls whether introductory messages are sent for each agent, setting the stage for their participation in the chat.
    - Comfy dtype: `BOOLEAN`
    - Python dtype: `bool`
- **`role_for_select_speaker_messages`**
    - Defines the role (e.g., system or user) assigned to messages involved in selecting the next speaker, influencing how these messages are perceived.
    - Comfy dtype: `COMBO[STRING]`
    - Python dtype: `str`
- **`clear_history`**
    - Indicates whether the chat history should be cleared before starting, affecting the context available to agents.
    - Comfy dtype: `BOOLEAN`
    - Python dtype: `bool`
### Optional
- **`agent_i`**
    - Represents one of the multiple agents participating in the group chat, contributing to the dynamic interaction and conversation flow.
    - Comfy dtype: `AGENT`
    - Python dtype: `Dict[str, Any]`
## Output types
- **`chat_history`**
    - Comfy dtype: `STRING`
    - A record of all messages exchanged during the group chat, capturing the flow and content of the conversation.
    - Python dtype: `str`
- **`summary`**
    - Comfy dtype: `STRING`
    - A summary of the chat, highlighting key points or outcomes from the group interaction.
    - Python dtype: `str`
## Usage tips
- Infra type: `CPU`
- Common nodes: unknown
